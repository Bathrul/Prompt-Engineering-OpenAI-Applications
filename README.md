# Prompt Engineering & OpenAI Project

This project focuses on designing, testing, and optimizing prompts to improve the performance of large language models for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and question answering.

## Project Overview
Prompt engineering plays a critical role in controlling the behavior and output quality of large language models. This project explores different prompt structures and optimization techniques to improve accuracy, relevance, and consistency.

## Key Tasks
- Prompt design for multiple NLP tasks
- Prompt optimization to reduce hallucinations
- Performance comparison between baseline and optimized prompts
- Evaluation of response quality

## Tools & Technologies
- OpenAI language models
- Python (for experimentation)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome
Optimized prompts demonstrated improved response accuracy, better contextual understanding, and reduced irrelevant outputs compared to baseline prompts.
